A notebook for running Netlogo models 'headless' (eg no GUI) by specifying parameters for an experiment. These parameters are passed to a bash script and run from within the notebook. Results are written to file for further analysis in the python. A variety of likely python data packages are also provided for import. (Others can be added by running `!pip install <package>` from within a notebook.
